# TicTacToe
  This is a small Python exercise (coding test) I needed to do during an interview process.
    
## Instructions
  Create a version of tic tac toe where you can play against the computer, the output should be on the console.
  When the game starts the grid will look as follows:

  1 | 2 | 3
  ---------
  4 | 5 | 6
  ---------
  7 | 8 | 9

  Player 1, please enter a number: 

  The player will choose a number and the cell will be replaced with X to mark the players move, the computer will
  then make a move and place a O in a cell that will stop the player from winning.

## How to Run
